# ctsubmit: REST API Documentation

## OpenAPI

An [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) definition for ctsubmit is provided by [openapi.yaml](/docs/openapi.yaml) and rendered in HTML [here](https://crtsh.github.io/ctsubmit/openapi.html).

## POST Endpoints

These endpoints accept a JSON request body containing a certificate chain and (extending the RFC6962 APIs) submission options. They return SCTs collected from CT logs.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `/add-chain` | Submit an X.509 certificate to CT logs. |
| `/add-pre-chain` | Submit a precertificate to CT logs. |

### Request Body

The request body is a JSON object with the following properties:

| Name | Required? | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chain` | Required | — | An array of base64-encoded DER certificates. The first element is the end-entity certificate; subsequent elements chain to the previous and so on to the root or a certificate that chains to a known root certificate. |
| `policyCompliant` | Optional | `true` | If true, ensure the resulting SCT list meets the requirements of the applicable CT policies. |
| `testLogs` | Optional | `false` | If true, submit to test CT logs instead of production CT logs. |
| `mimics` | Optional | `false` | If true, also generate SCTs from the [log mimics](https://googlechrome.github.io/CertificateTransparency/3p_libraries.html). |
| `operators` | Optional | `1` | The minimum number of distinct log operators from which to obtain SCTs. Overridden if `policyCompliant` is true and the applicable CT policies require more. |
| `scts` | Optional | `1` | The minimum number of SCTs to obtain. Overridden if `policyCompliant` is true and the applicable CT policies require more. |
| `requireAtLeastOneRFC6962SCT` | Optional | `false` | If true, require at least one SCT from an RFC 6962 log. Automatically set to true when `policyCompliant` is true (Apple CT policy). |
| `preferAtLeastOneStaticSCT` | Optional | `false` | If true, prefer at least one SCT from a Static CT API log. Automatically set to true when `policyCompliant` is true (Mozilla preference). |
| `verbose` | Optional | `false` | If true, include the submission strategy details in the response. |

### Response Configuration

The following `response.*` configuration options control which fields are included in successful responses:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `response.includeLogResponses` | `true` | Include the `logResponse` array (raw add-chain/add-pre-chain responses). |
| `response.includeSCTList` | `false` | Include the `sctListB64` field (pre-marshaled TLS-encoded SCT list, `add-pre-chain` only). |
| `response.produceFinalTBSCert` | `false` | Include the `finalTBSCertB64` and `ctlint` fields (`add-pre-chain` only). |

Review the [Security Considerations](#security-considerations) before enabling `response.includeSCTList` and/or `response.produceFinalTBSCert`.

### Response Format

The response format can be selected using the `format` query parameter or the `Accept` header:

| Format | Query parameter | Content-Type |
|---|---|---|
| JSON (default) | `?format=json` | `application/json` |
| HTML | `?format=html` | `text/html` |

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://ctsubm.it/add-chain \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chain": [
      "<base64-encoded leaf certificate>",
      "<base64-encoded intermediate certificate>"
    ],
    "policyCompliant": true
  }'
```

### Success Response (HTTP 200)

A successful response contains the collected SCTs and, for precertificate submissions, may also contain additional fields:

```json
{
  "logResponse": [
    {
      "sct_version": 0,
      "id": "<base64-encoded log ID>",
      "timestamp": 1234567890123,
      "extensions": "",
      "signature": "<base64-encoded signature>"
    }
  ],
  "sctListB64": "<base64-encoded TLS-encoded SCT list>",
  "finalTBSCertB64": "<base64-encoded TBSCertificate>",
  "ctlint": [
    {
      "finding": "Description of the finding",
      "severity": "warning"
    }
  ],
  "strategy": [...]
}
```

| Field | Presence | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `logResponse` | When `response.includeLogResponses` config is enabled (default: `true`) | Array of SCT responses from CT logs. |
| `sctListB64` | `add-pre-chain` only, when `response.includeSCTList` config is enabled (default: `false`) | Base64-encoded TLS-encoded SCT list. Use this to construct the SCT list X.509 extension and embed it in your own TBSCertificate. |
| `finalTBSCertB64` | `add-pre-chain` only, when `response.produceFinalTBSCert` config is enabled (default: `false`) | Base64-encoded TBSCertificate with the collected SCTs embedded as an SCT list extension and the CT poison extension removed. **WARNING:** Signing this value blindly means trusting ctsubmit with your CA's signing key output. See [Security Considerations](#security-considerations). |
| `ctlint` | `add-pre-chain` only, when `response.produceFinalTBSCert` config is enabled (default: `false`) | Array of [ctlint](https://github.com/crtsh/ctlint) findings for CT policy compliance checking. |
| `strategy` | When `verbose=true` | Array of strategy members showing which logs were considered, their priority buckets, and submission outcomes. |

### Security Considerations

By default (`response.includeLogResponses` configuration option enabled), ctsubmit returns only the individual log responses (`logResponse`). Since there have been a number of [CA incidents](https://github.com/crtsh/ctlint#why-you-need-ctlint) in the past due to mistakes made when processing log responses, ctsubmit provides two further configuration options to assist CAs:

- The `response.includeSCTList` configuration option (default: `false`) enables the `sctListB64` response field.

- The `response.produceFinalTBSCert` configuration option (default: `false`) enables the `finalTBSCertB64` and `ctlint` response fields.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is RECOMMENDED that the CA verifies whichever of these response fields it intends to use, so that a compromise of the ctsubmit service cannot lead to the signing of arbitrary data.

For ctsubmit to remain outside a CA's trusted computing base, even if the CA is running its own instance of ctsubmit:

- The CA needs to independently verify each SCT signature using the public key of the corresponding log.

- The CA needs to independently construct the marshaled SCT list/extension and final TBSCertificate.

As long as the SCTs are kept in the same order as in `logResponse` and the SCT list extension is the last extension in the final TBSCertificate constructed by the CA, the CA can check its work by comparing against `sctListB64` and `finalTBSCertB64` and requiring a byte-for-byte match.

### Error Response (HTTP 400)

Error responses use [RFC 7807 Problem Details](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807):

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "detail": "Description of the error"
}
```

### Timeout Response (HTTP 503)

If the request times out (exceeds `server.requestTimeout`), a `503 Service Unavailable` response is returned.

## Policy-Compliant Submissions

When `policyCompliant` is `true` (the default), ctsubmit automatically enforces the SCT requirements from the applicable CT policies:

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum SCTs | 2 (or 3 if certificate validity > 180 days) |
| Minimum distinct operators | 2 |
| Require at least one RFC 6962 SCT | Yes (Apple CT policy) |
| Prefer at least one Static CT SCT | Yes (Mozilla preference) |

For BIMI Mark Certificates, the Usable BIMI log list is used instead of the Usable TLS log list.

## GET Endpoints

### Web Forms

Browse (i.e., send a GET request) to the `add-chain` or `add-pre-chain` endpoint to access an interactive submission form where you can paste a PEM-encoded certificate chain and configure submission options.

### Log Lists

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `/usable_tls_logs.json` | Usable TLS CT logs — the intersection of logs marked as usable by Chrome, Apple, and Mozilla. Used for policy-compliant TLS submissions. |
| `/active_tls_logs.json` | Active TLS CT logs — all non-test logs from the crt.sh active log list. Used for non-policy-compliant submissions. |
| `/test_tls_logs.json` | Test CT logs — test-flagged logs from the crt.sh active log list. Used when `testLogs` is true. |
| `/usable_bimi_logs.json` | Usable BIMI CT logs — BIMI-approved logs from the crt.sh approved log list. Used for BIMI Mark Certificate submissions. |

### Dashboard

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | Submission dashboard showing per-log monitoring data. |

The dashboard accepts an optional `loglist` query parameter:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `usabletls` (default) | Usable TLS logs |
| `activetls` | Active TLS logs |
| `testtls` | Test logs |
| `usablebimi` | Usable BIMI logs |

The dashboard displays the following information for each log:

- **STH status** — tree size, Maximum Merge Delay, and STH age.
- **Endpoint uptime** — 24-hour and 90-day uptime percentages.
- **Recent outcomes** — submission success/failure counts in the last 30 seconds.
- **Response latency** — average response time in the last 30 seconds.
- **Backoff state** — current backoff/dispreferal status and reason.

## CTLint Severity Levels

For precertificate submissions where `response.produceFinalTBSCert` is enabled, [ctlint](https://github.com/crtsh/ctlint) findings are included in the response with the following severity levels:

| Severity | Description |
|---|---|
| `info` | Informational finding. |
| `notice` | Notable observation. |
| `warning` | Potential issue that may indicate non-compliance. |
| `error` | Non-compliance with a CT policy requirement. |
| `bug` | Likely a bug in the linter itself. |
| `fatal` | Critical error that prevents further processing. |

## Strategy Buckets

When `verbose=true`, the response includes the `strategy` field, which reveals how ctsubmit prioritized each log for this request and also the response times and outcomes for each submission attempt.

| Priority | Bucket | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Highest | `PREFERRED_BYCONFIG` | Log URL matches a configured preference regex. |
| | `NEUTRAL` | Default — no special signals. |
| | `DISPREFERRED_SLOWRESPONSES` | Recent slow response backoff in effect. |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENT4XX` | Recent HTTP 4xx backoff in effect. |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENT5XX` | Recent HTTP 5xx backoff in effect. |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENTTIMEOUT` | Recent timeout backoff in effect. |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENTBADRESPONSE` | Recent bad response backoff in effect. |
| | `DISPREFERRED_LOWUPTIME` | Low submission-endpoint uptime. |
| | `DISPREFERRED_MMDBLOWN` | STH age exceeds the log's Maximum Merge Delay. |
| Lowest | `EXCLUDED` | Explicitly excluded by configuration, or no STH data available. |
