# Submission Strategy

This document describes how ctsubmit selects CT logs and submits certificate chains to achieve a policy-compliant quorum of Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs).

## Overview

The submission pipeline has four stages:

1. **Determine requirements** — how many SCTs and distinct operators are needed.
2. **Find compatible logs** — filter the log list by temporal compatibility and chain validation.
3. **Devise a strategy** — rank and bucket the compatible logs.
4. **Execute submissions** — submit to logs concurrently, collect responses, and evaluate quorum.

## 1. Submission Requirements (`request.go`)

The caller can set explicit values for `SCTs` (total SCT count) and `Operators` (distinct operator count). When `PolicyCompliant` is true and the certificate is not a BIMI Mark Certificate, CT policy rules are enforced:

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum SCTs | 2 (or 3 if certificate validity > 180 days) |
| Minimum distinct operators | 2 |
| `RequireAtLeastOneRFC6962SCT` | **true** (Apple CT policy) |
| `PreferAtLeastOneStaticSCT` | **true** (Mozilla preference) |

`SCTs` is always ≥ `Operators` and both are ≥ 1.

## 2. Compatible Log Selection (`compatibleLogs.go`)

Starting from the appropriate base log list (Usable TLS, Usable BIMI, Test, or crt.sh Active), the following filters are applied:

- **Expiry check** — if policy compliance is required, expired certificates are rejected.
- **Temporal compatibility** — the log's temporal interval must cover the certificate's validity period.
- **Policy state** — when policy compliance is required, only logs in the `Usable` state (and not `ReadOnly`, `Retired`, or `Rejected`) are used.
- **Chain validation** — the certificate chain must validate to one of the log's accepted root certificates. Validation results are cached per chain/log pair.
- **Sufficiency check** — if there are not enough compatible logs/operators to meet the requirements, submission is aborted early.

## 3. Strategy (`strategy.go`)

Each compatible log is placed into a `StrategyMember` struct and assigned a bucket that determines its priority. Buckets are sorted from most to least preferred:

| Priority | Bucket | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Highest | `PREFERRED_BYCONFIG` | Log URL matches a configured preference regex |
| | `NEUTRAL` | Default — no special signals |
| | `DISPREFERRED_SLOWRESPONSES` | Recent slow response backoff in effect |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENT4XX` | Recent HTTP 4xx backoff in effect |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENT5XX` | Recent HTTP 5xx backoff in effect |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENTTIMEOUT` | Recent timeout backoff in effect |
| | `DISPREFERRED_RECENTBADRESPONSE` | Recent bad response backoff in effect |
| | `DISPREFERRED_LOWUPTIME` | Low submission-endpoint uptime (24h or 90d) |
| | `DISPREFERRED_MMDBLOWN` | STH age exceeds the log's MMD |
| Lowest | `EXCLUDED` | Explicitly excluded by config, or no STH data available |

Within each bucket, logs are randomized to distribute load. Excluded logs are never submitted to.

### Dispreferal Signals

- **MMD blown** — the log's latest STH timestamp is older than its Maximum Merge Delay.
- **Low uptime** — the submission endpoint's 24-hour uptime or the lowest endpoint's 90-day uptime falls below configurable thresholds.
- **Backoff** — a recent bad response, timeout, 4xx, 5xx, or slow response was observed. Backoff durations are configurable and respect `Retry-After` headers for 4xx/5xx responses.

## 4. Submission Execution (`orchestrate.go`)

### Concurrency Model

The `submit()` function uses an event-driven loop with bounded concurrency:

1. **Initial batch** — up to N logs are submitted to concurrently, where N equals the number of SCTs required for quorum. This ensures maximum parallelism without overshooting.
2. **Event loop** — a central goroutine processes four event types from submission goroutines:
   - `eventSuccess` — HTTP 200 received and response successfully unmarshalled into an `AddChainResponse`.
   - `eventFailure` — HTTP error, non-200 status, timeout, unmarshal failure, or context cancellation.
   - `eventTryNext` — the try-next response threshold was exceeded but the request is still in-flight.
   - `eventSlow` — the slow-response threshold was exceeded (for metrics recording only).

### Try-Next Response Handling

Each submission goroutine races the HTTP request against two configurable timers:

- **Try-next timer** (`submission.tryNextResponseThreshold`) — when this fires, an `eventTryNext` is sent. The coordinator starts the next eligible log, but the original submission continues running and may still succeed.
- **Slow timer** (`submission.slowResponseThreshold`) — when this fires, an `eventSlow` is sent. This records the slow response via `monitor.RecordSlowResponse()` for future strategy dispreferal, but does **not** trigger starting a new submission.

On `eventSuccess` (when quorum is not yet met) or `eventFailure`, the next eligible log is started **only** if there are no other submissions still in-flight. This avoids eagerly overshooting and instead relies on the try-next timer to stagger launches.

### Quorum Evaluation

After each successful response, the `quorumState` is evaluated against all requirements:

| Check | Type | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `len(responses) >= SCTs` | Hard | Must collect enough total SCTs |
| `len(operators) >= Operators` | Hard | Must have enough distinct operators |
| `RequireAtLeastOneRFC6962SCT` | Hard | At least one SCT must come from an RFC 6962 log |
| `PreferAtLeastOneStaticSCT` | Soft | Influences log selection order but does not block quorum |

When quorum is met, the context is cancelled, all remaining in-flight and queued submissions are abandoned, and the successful responses are returned immediately.

### Smart Log Skipping

Before starting each subsequent log, `wouldHelp()` evaluates whether the candidate can contribute to the remaining requirements, **treating all in-flight submissions optimistically as if they will succeed**:

- If more total SCTs are needed (counting in-flight as successes), any log helps.
- If operator diversity is the gap (counting in-flight operators), only logs from a new operator help.
- If a specific log type is required (RFC 6962) or preferred (Static), only matching logs help.

Previously skipped logs are reconsidered on each call, because an in-flight request that previously made them redundant may have since failed. Logs that have already been attempted (`BeganAfter != 0`) are never reconsidered.

### Error Handling and Backoff Recording

Failed submissions record the appropriate backoff type in the `monitor` package, influencing future strategy decisions:

| Failure | Backoff recorded |
|---|---|
| Network timeout | `RecordTimeout` |
| HTTP 5xx | `Record5xxResponse` (respects `Retry-After`) |
| HTTP 4xx | `Record4xxResponse` (respects `Retry-After`) |
| Other HTTP errors, bad response body, unmarshal failure | `RecordBadResponse` |
| Slow response (threshold exceeded) | `RecordSlowResponse` |

### Termination

- **Success** — quorum achieved; return collected `AddChainResponse` values.
- **Failure** — all eligible logs attempted and quorum not achieved; return an error detailing how many SCTs and operators were obtained vs. required.

## Configuration

The following configuration values control submission behavior:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `submission.httpTimeout` | 15s | Per-log HTTP request timeout |
| `submission.tryNextResponseThreshold` | 500ms | Time before a log is considered slow and the next log is started |
| `submission.slowResponseThreshold` | 2s | Time before a log is recorded as slow for metrics and backoff |
| `strategy.backoff.badResponsePeriod` | 1m | Backoff duration after a bad response |
| `strategy.backoff.timeoutPeriod` | 1m | Backoff duration after a timeout |
| `strategy.backoff.default5xxPeriod` | 1m | Default backoff duration after HTTP 5xx (overridden by `Retry-After`) |
| `strategy.backoff.default4xxPeriod` | 1m | Default backoff duration after HTTP 4xx (overridden by `Retry-After`) |
| `strategy.backoff.slowResponsePeriod` | 1m | Backoff duration after a slow response |
| `strategy.uptimeThreshold.submitEndpoint24h` | 95% | Minimum 24h uptime for the submission endpoint |
| `strategy.uptimeThreshold.lowestEndpoint90d` | 99.25% | Minimum 90d uptime for the lowest endpoint |
| `strategy.excluded.operators` | [] | Operator names to exclude entirely |
| `strategy.excluded.logURLRegex` | [] | URL regexes to exclude logs by |
| `strategy.preferred.operators` | [] | Operator names to prefer |
| `strategy.preferred.logURLRegex` | [] | URL regexes to prefer logs by |
